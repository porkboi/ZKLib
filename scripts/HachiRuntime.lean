# Compiled nonrecursive-Hachi runtime checks

**What this certifies.** That the nonrecursive Hachi opening chain — `commit`, the
computable honest lifted witness, the concrete Ajtai lift commitment, the terminal
reveal-and-check, and the whole composed reduction `hachiNonrecursiveOpening` — is *executable*,
by running it at toy parameters against a deterministic oracle and checking that the honest run
is accepted. No theorem is proved here; the point is precisely the thing a theorem cannot say,
namely that every definition on the honest path compiles to code and produces an answer.

It is the executability half of the Aeneas extraction target: `hachiNonrecursiveConcrete`
(`Commitments/Functional/Hachi/Concrete.lean`) is what the Rust implementation is meant to agree
with, and an equivalence proof against something that cannot be run would be worth little.

**Why a compiled executable rather than `#eval`.** Files under `ArkLib/` are collected into the
generated library root, so a `#eval` there is paid on every build, and the interpreter is
far slower than compiled code on everything here. This mirrors `scripts/ToyProblemRuntime.lean`,
the repo's existing convention for compiled execution checks, and the default checks are wired
into `./scripts/validate.sh` the same way.

**Two entry points, and why.** With no argument the executable runs the checks that finish in
milliseconds — that is what `validate.sh` gates on. `--full` adds the composed run (**it passes**:
the verifier accepts, in about six minutes on one core), and `--timing` reports per-check timings.

The split is not cosmetic, and the asymmetry behind it is worth recording. The honest **sumcheck
prover** costs, by a very wide margin, more than everything else on the path put together: the
committer, the computable lift witness, the batching, the nested zero-check and the terminal
check together finish in milliseconds, while the composed run — the same chain plus the
sumcheck — takes minutes. The reason is the shape of the summand: `sumcheckPolyZero` is a
product of `bZero` copies of an `m₀`-variate multilinear extension, so it carries up to
`(bZero + 1)^m₀` monomials, and `computableRoundPoly` evaluates all of them at `2^(m₀ - i)`
points in round `i`. Here `m₀ = 4`, the digit-committed table being `(μ₀ + n₀·δ)·d = 16` rows
once the quotient block is committed as digits (`cubeCoversTable` certifies `16 ≤ 16` at compile
time), and `bZero = 3` — and the run still takes minutes, so this is the first thing to profile if
the honest prover is ever wanted at a realistic size. Every extra cube coordinate multiplies the
cost several-fold: raising `α` from `0` to `1` doubles `d` and so pushes `m₀` to `5`, and the
`τ = δ` table would have done the same.

**The parameters.** `q = 7`, `α = 0` (so `Rq = Z₇[X]/(X+1) ≅ Z₇`, ring dimension `d = 1`),
digit base `b = 3` (hence `δ = ⌈log₃ 7⌉ = 2`, for the message digits and — since `bZero = b` —
also for the quotient digits), one inner/outer/`D` row, `m = r = 0`, `μ₀ = 6`, `n₀ = 5`. The
range parameters sit at the healthy point the gadget decomposition buys — `bZero = b = 3` and
`γ = bZero − 1 = 2 < ⌊q/2⌋ = 3`, so Eq. (20)'s ball check is a real constraint (see `P` below) —
and the committed table is `μ₀ + n₀·δ = 16` rows wide, so `M + 1 = 4` already satisfies
`(μ₀ + n₀·δ)·deg φ ≤ 2^(M+1)` (`16 ≤ 16`, `cubeCoversTable`) — the `τ = δ` table's `18` rows
would have forced `M + 1 = 5`. Not `q = 5`, the
smallest prime admitting honest range parameters at all: the toy data below (keys, witnesses, the
separating pair of `liftComDistinguishes`) is built over `Z₇`. Deliberately tiny beyond that:
this is a code-generation check, and the security theorems are parametric, so nothing is learned
by running it larger.

**`τ` is explicit, and strictly below `δ`.** The folded-witness digit count is the parameter
`Tau = 1`, *not* `δ = 2` (`tauLtDigits`), so the composed run genuinely exercises the **bounded**
`z` decomposition (`boundedBalancedZmodDigitDecomposition`) rather than a full-width one; `ω` is
`1` so that the honest bound `2ʳ·ω·⌊b/2⌋ = 1` fits the balanced capacity of one base-`3` digit,
which is also `1` (`hcapToy` / `hzbToy`). Beyond the composed run, the bounded digit function is
checked directly at the **production** digit parameters `q = 4294967197`, `b = 16` and
`τ = 5` (`Params.lean`; [NOZ26] Figure 9's table says `τ = 4`, but §4.4's own rule gives `5`)
(`boundedDigitsReconstructProd`, `boundedDigitsInBoxProd`) — cheap, and the arithmetic an
extraction target has to reproduce. The full `ℓ = 30` prover is *not* run here.

`16·d ≤ 2^(M+1)`, and `MM = 3` meets it exactly (`16 ≤ 16`) — one coordinate fewer than the
`τ = δ` table's `18` rows needed, which is the sumcheck cost the `τ` separation saves here.
Without this hypothesis the checks can silently run on a truncated table: `wTable`
returns `0` off-cube, so every off-cube row would escape the range check and the `M̃_α`

The composed run above already goes through `boundedBalancedZmodDigitDecomposition` at `τ = 1`.
These checks exercise the same digit function *at the production digit parameters*
(`q = 4294967197`, `b = 16`, `τ = 5` — `HachiParams`, the `ℓ = 30` parameters at the digit count
[NOZ26] §4.4's rule yields, not Figure 9's tabulated `4`), where the interesting arithmetic lives
and where a full-width `5`-digit decomposition is impossible (`16⁵ < q`,
`HachiParams.sixteen_pow_tau_lt_q`). Cheap: a handful of `ZMod q` sums. -/
